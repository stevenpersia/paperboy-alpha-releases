## Description
Paperboy is a free self hosted solution for your management request API. At the moment, in alpha version, core features can be refactored.

**⚠️ Don't use for production. I share these releases for my entourage. There are a lot of bugs and some features are not correctly implemented.
These releases use a public shared real time database so be careful when you use it. Again, it's a demo.**

I will add settings feature so that you can fill your Firebase informations.

Paperboy in few words :

-   Free
-   Open source
-   Unlimited requests
-   Unlimited collections
-   Unlimited users
-   FREE !
-   Real time database
-   Easy to manage
-   Cool keyboard shortcuts
-   Yeah, it's free :)

## Specs

-   React
-   Firebase

## What is it ?
Paperboy is a light version of Postman. All core functions are implemented. Some more will come in future but I would like to keep it simple as possible ! Works on mac, only.

Already included :
- Methods : GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
- Auth: Bearer token.
- Params : Query and params.
- Others things : Status code and time of requests.

## Roadmap
-   Add more methods ("PATCH", "LINK", ...).
-   Handle multiple projects.
-   Add more auth solution.
-   Add tests.
-   And many more.

## Why this name ?
Really, you don't get it ?!
